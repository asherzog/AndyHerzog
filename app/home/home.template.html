      <p>All human things are subject to decay, Tomorrow do thy worst, for I have lived today. And winter storms invert the year? Why should a foolish marriage vow, 'Tis a madness that he should be jealous of me, Rich with immortal green above the rest: Thus Nisus fell upon the slippery place, What satisfaction thou art pleas'd to make. Now tamely glad her unjust claim to cease And farther love in store, Which long ago was made, As thou whole Eth'ridge dost transfuse to thine? And ev'ry life but mine recall. As Hannibal did to the altars come, A louder yet, and yet a louder strain! Fought all his battles o'er again, Or that I should bar him of another;</p>
