      <p>
        Andy is a web developer based in Denver, CO. He enjoys the multitude of challenges the software industry presents and the sense of ownership one feels for the code they use to solve these tasks. After earning his degree in economics from Colorado State University, he attended the Galvanize Web Development Immersive program to turn his coding hobby into a career and truly put his problem solving skills to the test.

      <p>When he's not at work practicing his craft, you may find Andy dunking on some poor soul in the basketball gym, out-driving Tiger Woods on the golf course, or brewing the next great Pale Ale. He has plans to eventually visit every state (currently at 20), thoroughly enjoys the cinema, and tries to stay as up to date with current affairs as one can sanely be.
